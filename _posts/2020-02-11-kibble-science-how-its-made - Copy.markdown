Have you ever wondered how your cat’s kibble (dry food) is made? If so, we thought you might find the science behind it interesting. We certainly did! ^..^<

Take a walk thru your local pet store and you’ll see dozens of different kibble brands to choose from available in shapes ranging from tiny balls, squares, triangles and even animal shapes like fish or chicken.

Take a walk thru your local pet store and you’ll see dozens of different kibble brands to choose from available in shapes ranging from tiny balls, squares, triangles and even animal shapes like fish or chicken.


All kibble, regardless of brand, are supposed to be nutritionally balanced and complete, so that your cat’s basic dietary needs are met by the ingredients. However, not all are. Each proprietary recipe from the various kibble manufacturers will include protein sources like beef, chicken and eggs, as well as grains, cereals, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

##How Kibble is Made

These raw wet and dry ingredients are first mixed together and then pulverized to make a special paste like dough. Once this dough is prepared, it must then be cooked and formed. This is done by a process called ‘extrusion’ using a machine called an expander (or extruder).

The dough is fed into the expander which cooks it using pressurized steam or hot water. The cooked dough is pushed (or extruded) through specially sized and shaped holes (called die), where it is then cut off by sharp blades. The timing of the whole process is critical because if the cooked dough isn’t cut quickly enough (while still compacted from the high pressure) it will naturally puff up and no longer be usable as kibble.

These newly formed dough pieces are then passed through a dryer to remove any remaining moisture. The resulting kibble is sprayed with fats, oils, minerals and vitamins and sealed in packages ready for consumption.

Fun Fact: These extruder machines were originally created to produce puffed breakfast cereals, and subsequently modified for manufacturing large quantities of nutritious, shelf-stable pet foods.

##Kibble Science

Some of you may know that our cats are only fed Royal Canin food (both kibble and wet) and since Royal Canin is a leader in kibble research and development, we asked them to share a bit more about their unique design process.

##Here’s what they shared with us…

As far as cats are concerned, the first criteria they exhibit in choosing whether or not they like a particular food is its palatability. In other words, is the food acceptable or agreeable to the cat’s unique palate or taste. This is a critical element in how Royal Canin designs and produces their own kibble.
