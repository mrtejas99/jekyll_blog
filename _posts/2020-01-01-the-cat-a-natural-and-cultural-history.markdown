We were so excited to come across this remarkable new book called The Cat ~ it’s a comprehensive, richly illustrated exploration of the natural and cultural history of this much-loved pet. Filled with surprising facts, The Cat will enchant anyone with an interest in, or a love for, these ameowzing animals.

This is truly a quintessential ‘must have’ reference book for any ailurophile (cat lover) that features clear and accessible text plus infographics, diagrams, and some 250 stunning color photographs.

Of all the domesticated species, cats have enjoyed the most complex relationship with people—one that still leads to arguments about whether you can truly call the cat asleep by your fire “tame.” 

With chapters on Evolution & Development, Anatomy & Biology, Society & Behavior, and Cats & Humans this book takes different angles on matters feline, offering rich information and valuable insights.

Topics include kitten development, the hierarchy of cats, how cats think, communication between cats and people, historic and extinct breeds, the challenges facing cats today and how we can help, and much, much more.

The book also features a visually stunning photographic directory of more than forty popular breeds, with essential information about each.
